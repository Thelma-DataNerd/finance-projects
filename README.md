This repository contains my finance-related data analysis and machine learning projects.
It showcases a variety of real-world work in the finance sector â€” including exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and data visualization.

Each project is organized in its own folder with a brief description, code notebooks, data sources, insights and reports.
