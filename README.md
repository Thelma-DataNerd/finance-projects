### Overview
This repository contains my finance-related data analysis and machine learning projects.
It showcases a variety of real-world work in the finance sector â€” including exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and data visualization.

Each project is organized in its own folder with a brief description, code notebooks, data sources, insights and reports.

### Credit Card Fraud Prediction System:
- Objectives: 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. 
The goal is to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent or legitimate, 
thereby reducing financial losses due to fraud and improving overall transaction security.

- Content:
The dataset shows credit card transactions from European cardholders in September 2013.
It consists solely of numerical input variables, which have been derived through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, reducing the original feature set into a more compact and simplified form.

- Motivation
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals alike, 
resulting in substantial financial losses annually. Traditional rule-based systems often struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of fraud patterns. 
This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a robust fraud detection model, 
enabling more accurate and efficient identification of fraudulent transactions

- Steps_Taken:
Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, model evaluation using AUC-ROC and other metrics, comparison with decision tree and random forest models

- Results:
  * The Random forest model outperformed others in detecting fraudulanet transactions while miniizing false positives.
  * The AUC-ROC score (0.9478) for Random forest suggests high discriminatory power between fraus and non-fraud transactions.
  * Feature importance analysis revealed that V14,V4, V3, and V8 were the most significant in fraud detection.
  * The system effectively detects fraudulent transactions with high accurracy and precision.
 
### Credit Card Risk Analysis
- Objectives:
  * To evaluate the creditworthiness of individual borrowers, in other to determine the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts on time.
  * To analyze the credit risk data, identifying trends and patterns, give insights, and recommendations.

- Content: The GermanCredit dataset consist of data of customers applying for a loan.

- Steps_Taken: Data exploration and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, presentation.

- Results:
  * Most borrowers have low checking and saving balances.
  * Most defaulting borrowers are single men.
  * Defaulting borrowers tend to have no co-applicant or gurantor, increasing loan risk.
  * Borrowers took loans primarily for car purchases, radios and furnitures, which are not income generating assests.
  * Foreign workers and skilled employees formed a significant portion of loan defaulters.
  * Features like credit history, checking balance, and loan duration had the highest influence on default predictions.
