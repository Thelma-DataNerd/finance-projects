### Overview
This repository contains my finance-related data analysis and machine learning projects.
It showcases a variety of real-world work in the finance sector â€” including exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and data visualization.

Each project is organized in its own folder with a brief description, code notebooks, data sources, insights and reports.

### Credit Card Fraud Prediction System:
- Objectives: This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent or legitimate, thereby reducing financial losses due to fraud and improving overall transaction security.
- Content: The dataset shows credit card transactions from European cardholders in September 2013.
It consists solely of numerical input variables, which have been derived through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, reducing the original feature set into a more compact and simplified form.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Techniques: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling imbalanced datasets, feature engineering, data preprocessing, model building and evaluation using AUC-ROC and other performance metrics, and model comparison across different algorithm
- Outcome:
  * The Random forest model outperformed others in detecting fraudulanet transactions while miniizing false positives.
  * The AUC-ROC score (0.9478) for Random forest suggests high discriminatory power between fraus and non-fraud transactions.
  * Feature importance analysis revealed that V14,V4, V3, and V8 were the most significant in fraud detection.
  * The system effectively detects fraudulent transactions with high accurracy and precision.

### Loan Risk Analysis
- Objectives: To evaluate the creditworthiness of individual borrowers, in other to determine the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts on time.
- Content: The GermanCredit dataset consist of customers data applying for a loan.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI (for visualization), PowerPoint (for presentation)
- Technique: Data exploration and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, insights and recommendation, presentation.

- Outcome:
  * Most borrowers have low checking and saving balances.
  * Most defaulting borrowers are single men.
  * Defaulting borrowers tend to have no co-applicant or gurantor, increasing loan risk.
  * Borrowers took loans primarily for car purchases, radios and furnitures, which are not income generating assests.
  * Foreign workers and skilled employees formed a significant portion of loan defaulters.
  * Features like credit history, checking balance, and loan duration had the highest influence on default predictions.
